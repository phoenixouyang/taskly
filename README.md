## About The Project
Taskly is a simple task management application designed to help users stay organized and productive. It features a simple registration and login system where users can securely manage personalized to-do lists. Taskly showcases both SQL and NoSQL databases by storing user accounts in MongoDB and managing task data through PostgreSQL.

Users can add tasks, update their status from pending to completed, edit details or remove them entirely. Validation is implemented on both the client and server side to ensure clean, reliable data.
